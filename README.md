# Unofficial Pokedex!
This project was implemented using JavaScript the Streamlit framework, and the PokeAPI. It serves to give data on any pokemon the user selects from the first generation. However, there are more features that will be discussed below.

This is what a user sees when they open the application.

# Features
### 1. Pokedex
  
  As seen in the picture above, users can select a pokemon in the select box and see a variety of statistics and information related to that pokemon.
  
### 2. Interactive Table

  Similar to the pokedex, users select a pokemon using the same selectbox, only this time a table is displayed showing every move a pokemon can learn and the level they learn it at.
  
### 3. Pokemon GO Map

  In Pokemon GO, some pokemon only spawn in certain regions, users can find out where certain pokemon spawn in Pokemon GO through this map. Since not every pokemon is region locked, the list is shortened to only those pokemon that are specific to a region.

### 4. Pokemon Trivia

  In the trivia section, a random pokemon is displayed. The user is prompted to guess the pokemom's name and type. Success or failure boxes will be generated depending on if the user answers correctly or not.
  
 ### 5. Pokemon Look-Alike

  Lastly, the user can drag in or upload a file of a picture to find their "look-alike".
